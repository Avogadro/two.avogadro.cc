# Documenting Code

We use [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) to generate documentation,
and make use of the JavaDoc style. They go in the header next to the
declaration, all classes should have at a minimum a brief description
with one or two sentences explaining what the intended purpose of the
class is.

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Your documentation goes here.
 */
void doSomething();
```

(class-descriptions)=

## Class Descriptions

- Minimum of a brief overview of the class

- Add include path for users of the class

- If appropriate, point out alternate/similar classes

- Ideally give some simple examples of using the class

  - Demonstrate core functionality in the simplest way possible

```cpp
namespace MoleQueue
{
/**
 * @class JsonRpcClient jsonrpcclient.h <molequeue/client/jsonrpcclient.h>
 * @brief The JsonRpcClient class is used by clients to submit calls to an RPC
 * server using JSON-RPC 2.0.
 * @author Marcus D. Hanwell
 *
 * Provides a simple Qt C++ API to make JSON-RPC 2.0 calls to an RPC server. To
 * create a client connection and call a method the following should be done:
 *
 @code
 #include <molequeue/client/jsonrpcclient.h>

 MoleQueue::JsonRpcClient *client = new MoleQueue::JsonRpcClient(this);
 client->connectToServer("MyRpcServer");
 QJsonObject request(client->emptyRequest());
 request["method"] = QLatin1String("listQueues");
 client->sendRequest(request);
 @endcode
 *
 * You should connect to the appropriate signals in order to act on results,
 * notifications and errors received in response to requests set using the
 * client connection.
 */

class JsonRpcClient : public QObject
{
};

} // End namespace MoleQueue
```

## Function Descriptions

- @brief descriptions:

  - Use complete sentences

- Constructors should be more that "Constructor", such as "Constructs
  the ... with ..."

- Use complete sentences to describe parameters

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Set the input file for the job.
 * @param fileName The file name as it will appear in the working directory.
 * @param contents The contents of the file specified.
 * @return true if the input file was successfully set, false otherwise.
 */
bool setInputFile(const QString &fileName, const QString &contents);
```
