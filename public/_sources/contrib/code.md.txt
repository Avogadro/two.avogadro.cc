# Contributing Code

If you're interested in contributing code to Avogadro, we recommend
that you understand the [GitHub Flow] including [Forking Repositories]
to make changes with the [Git] version control system, and finally
making a [Pull Request] for others to review, test, and merge into
the main version of Avogadro.

We have several suggestions as far as coding style and conventions in C++
as well as the need to document your code with comments and Doxygen API
docs (which ultimately become part of this website).
