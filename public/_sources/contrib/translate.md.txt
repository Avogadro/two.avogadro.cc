# Translations

Translations and localizations are made available through [Weblate]. As features are added, automated tasks will add new phrases to the translation templates. Whenever improvements are made to the translations and localizations on Weblate, they will be merged into the Avogadro code on [GitHub](https://github.com/openchemistry/avogadrolibs).

In general, to allow time for translation and localization, we will work to "freeze strings" at least a week in advance of a release.

If you encounter issues with translations, please file a bug report on [GitHub](https://github.com/openchemistry/avogadrolibs/issues/) or discuss on [our forum](https://discuss.avogadro.cc/)
