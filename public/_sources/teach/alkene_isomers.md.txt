# Alkene Isomers

Investigate the stability of alkene isomers due to steric interactions.

## Task

Build and optimize the geometry of isomeric alkenes and compare their relative energies to confirm empirical rules for evaluating alkene stability: Zaitsefâ€™s rule, cis- vs trans-, isolate vs conjugated dienes.

Examples:
- Compare: 1-hexene, 2-hexene (cis and trans), 2-methyl-2-pentene, 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene.
- Compare: 1,4-pentadiene and 1,3-pentadiene.
