# Basic VSEPR

Investigate molecular geometries using VSEPR rules.

## Task

Build and optimize the geometry of simple molecules to illustrate VSEPR theory.

- For organic-type molecules, use the MMFF94 forcefield.

Examples: methane, water, ammonia, etc.

- For octahedral-based geometries, use the UFF forcefield which is optimized for all elements.

Examples: SF<sub>6</sub>, IF<sub>5</sub>, XeF<sub>4</sub>, etc.

- Try even 7, 8, or 9 atoms around a central metal - how do the VSEPR rules extend beyond octahedral molecules?
