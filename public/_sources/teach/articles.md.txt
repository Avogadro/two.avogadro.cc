# Educational Publications Using Avogadro

A variety of activities and resources using Avogadro have been published in journals such as *J. Chem. Ed.*

## Yes We Chem

The website ["Yes We Chem"](https://yeswechem.org) includes English and Italian tutorials and exercises for teaching chemistry with Avogadro. 

> The team of **YesWeChem®** is formed by teachers, authors of text- and coursebooks, chemists and enthusiasts of this wonderful science.
