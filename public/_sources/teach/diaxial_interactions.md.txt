# 1,3-diaxial interactions

Investigate steric interactions in cyclohexane derivatives.

## Tasks

1. Create and optimize the geometry of a cyclohexane molecule.
2. Add methyl substituents to the 1 and 3 positions in a diequatorial arrangement, optimize the geometry and note the energy.
3. Delete the diequatorial substituents to return to cyclohexane, and optimize the geometry again.
4. Place methyl substituents in 1,3-diaxial positions, optimize the geometry and note the movement of the groups and the energy.
