# HCN dipole

Investigate polar intermolecular interactions using HCN.

## Task

Create two molecules of HCN, run a force field geometry optimization. Check the orientation of the molecules, note the energy of interaction. Find primary dipoles, compare length of interatomic and intermolecular bonds.
