# Educational Publications Using Avogadro

A variety of activities and resources using Avogadro have been published in journals such as *J. Chem. Ed.*

## Understanding Organic Chemistry Through Computation

There is a free LibreText [*Understanding Organic Chemistry Through Computation*](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Understanding_Organic_Chemistry_Through_Computation_(Boaz_and_Pearce)) written by Nicholas Boaz and Orion Pearce.

> This online textbook works to clarify challenging concepts in introductory organic chemistry by applying tools from computational chemistry to validate fundamental principles. […] Throughout this work, exercises are shown with step-by-step illustrated instructions and are designed to be completed using a standard desktop computer

## Yes We Chem

The website ["Yes We Chem"](https://yeswechem.org) includes English and Italian tutorials and exercises for teaching chemistry with Avogadro. 

> The team of **YesWeChem®** is formed by teachers, authors of text- and coursebooks, chemists and enthusiasts of this wonderful science.
