# Avogadro 1.91.0

22 August 2018

We are pleased to announce the latest release of Avogadro, including piles of
bug fixes and feature enhancements.

This release has a lot of new work completed over the last year, including the results of our first Google Summer of Code where two students worked on projects under the program.
