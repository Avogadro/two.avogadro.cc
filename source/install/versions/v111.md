# Avogadro v1.1.1

Avogadro 1.1.1 was released on December 11, 2013.

What's New
----------

This release marks the second of a new set of development "beta" releases of Avogadro, for adventurous users and programmers. It's stable enough for day-to-day use--we use it ourselves. That said, we expect there are bugs, missing features, and we do not yet recommend it for Linux distributions to package, since the programming interfaces may still change before 1.2.0 is released.

Most importantly, we seek community feedback as to needed features, bug reports, and anything else. Thanks!

The following list includes some of the changes since [Avogadro 1.1.0](Avogadro 1.1.0 "wikilink").
