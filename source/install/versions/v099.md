New beta releases are expected roughly once per month until the 1.0.0 release. You can [download this release here](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=165310&package_id=187449).

What's New
----------

The following list includes some of the changes since [Avogadro 0.9.8](Avogadro 0.9.8 "wikilink"). This is a bug fix release with some feature enhancements since our last release.



-   Updated user interface and icons.
-   Updated translations.
-   More bugs found and fixed.


Known Issues & Limitations
--------------------------

This release is a beta release and is intended to gain feedback and interest in the project.

The code currently expects to be editing one 3D molecule per file with one coordinate set. This means:

-   Editing a multi-molecule file will only edit the first molecule. Saving will overwrite all records except the first.
-   Saving to a 2D format will not necessarily produce correct 2D stereochemistry.



-   Several builder features are not implemented, including:
    -   Crystal structure builder
    -   Carbon Nanotube builder
    -   Z-matrix editor (early version committed - needs more work)



-   Export graphics will only save the current resolution in the window in bitmap form.
