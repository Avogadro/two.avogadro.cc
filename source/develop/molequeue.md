# Avogadro::MoleQueue

MoleQueue classes handle interaction with the MoleQueue queue system
for submitting calculations to programs and  opening completed output
files.

```{tip}
While MoleQueue is not actively developed, some features of Avogadro
are still handled by this code, including [RPC](develop-rpc) for
scripting `avogadroapp` and handling scripts for input generator dialogs.
