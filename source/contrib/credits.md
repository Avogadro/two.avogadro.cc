# Thanks

Avogadro, like many open source projects is helped by a cast of many. We
are fundamentally a community project and aim to offer open development,
responsive to users and contributors alike. Our hope is that many will
build on top of the core Avogadro framework, so we are very
grateful to all contributors:

## Creators

Avogadro was started by Geoff Hutchison, working with Donald Curtis and
Marcus Hanwell. The Avogadro v2 effort was started with Marcus Hanwell,
Allison Vacanti, and others at Kitware, Inc. as part of the Open
Chemistry effort.
