# Optimizing Geometry

Avogadro offers several methods to optimize the geometry of your system before further calculations, including menu commands and the interactive [AutoOptimize](tools-autoopt-tool) tool.

This section discusses more details on the methods used for optimization, use of geometry constraints to control optimization, and generation and use of conformers.
