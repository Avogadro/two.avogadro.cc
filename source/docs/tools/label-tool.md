# Label Tool

![The icon of the Label Tool in light mode.](../../_static/icon_label.svg)

Keyboard shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd>

The **Label Tool** is used to **add custom text** to atoms.

## Basic usage

**Left-click** on an atom to **create a new label**.
A cursor will appear.

Type the desired label with the keyboard.

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or click anywhere else in the view pane to confirm the new label.

:::{warning}
By default, atom labels are not visible in Avogadro!

To show labels, enable the `Labels` display type in the [Display Types pane](panes-display-types). Open the options for the `Labels` display type by clicking the three bullets **â‹¯**

Then, to show the custom labels, in the `Atom Label` drop-down of the Display Type Configuration pane, change the selected label type to **Custom**.
:::

Edit an existing label by left-clicking on it.
Its position will raise slightly to indicate that it is being edited.

## Pane options

There are currently no options for this tool in the Edit Labels pane.

The Label Tool is a work in progress and the ability to customize individual labels will likely come in future releases.

Display settings for *all* labels, such as text color and placement, can be changed in the [Display Type Configuration pane](panes-display-types-labels) for the `Labels` display type.
