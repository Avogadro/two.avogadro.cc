# Language

By default Avogadro will use your system language, but you can change this by going to `Extensions` ⇒ `User Interface Language…`.

Avogadro is available in many languages. Languages with significant coverage as of v1.99 include English (US, GB, AU, CA), Chinese, Esperanto, French, Georgian, German, Hungarian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (PT, BR), Serbian, Spanish, and Turkish. Many others have partial coverage and are in progress all the time!

Translation is an ongoing community effort so there are likely to be many errors or inconsistencies. If you find something wrong or missing, please suggest improvements!

If you would like to fix a mistranslation, add support for a language you speak, or contribute to a partially translated one, we'd love it – see [here](contrib-translate) for information on contributing.
