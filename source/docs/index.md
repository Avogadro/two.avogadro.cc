# Introduction

Avogadro is a free, open source molecular editor and visualization tool, designed for use on Mac, Windows, and Linux in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, bioinformatics, materials science, and related areas. It offers flexible high quality rendering and a powerful plugin architecture.

## Avogadro 2

In particular, this manual covers the new release of Avogadro 2, a major update, and includes major changes, the revised interface, and new features. Most sections include notes on changes from v1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 to the new 2.0 release.

For new features, a "**New in 2.0**" heading is included.

The revised manual also includes tips and warnings as call-out sections:

```{warning}
This is a warning - pay attention to something that may cause problems
```

```{tip}
This is a tip - something that can help you work better
```

## Thanks

This book would not be possible without the help and effort of many people, including Avogadro developers, translators, and users world-wide.

Funding for the Avogadro manual was provided by the [University of Pittsburgh Department of Chemistry](http://www.chem.pitt.edu/).
