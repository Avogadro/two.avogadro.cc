# What's New in Avogadro 2

Avogadro 2 represents a major update to the program, rewritten from the ground up. Many years were required to redesign the core of the program and bring over features from v1.0-1.2. (If you used any of the 1.90-1.99 betas, you may have noticed missing features.)

Thank you to all the developers, contributors, and testers of the beta releases. Without feedback and suggestions Avogadro 2 would not exist.

Major concerns in Avogadro 1.0 focused on stability (i.e., crashes) and speed, particularly with molecules or systems over a few hundred atoms. **Avogadro v2 was designed for fast modern rendering and improved stability. It is a platform to make it easy to build the next generation of molecular and materials visualization and editing tools.**
