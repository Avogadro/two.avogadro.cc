# Making Selections

The [Selection Tool](tools-selection-tool) is also a useful feature to master when beginning to learn Avogadro. Generally, the Selection Tool allows for the individual selection of atoms, bonds, or fragments.

The Selection Tool provides you with the ability to select a single atom within a molecule. This is achieved by left-clicking the atom. Pressing and holding <kbd>shift</kbd> while clicking allows for the selection of multiple atoms.

Right-clicking on an empty part of the view will clear the selection made.

```{warning}
A known bug means that on some systems, multiple left-clicks are required to clear the selection.
```

You can also double-click on an atom to select all atoms connected within that fragment or molecule.

Left-clicking and dragging a marquee with the cursor is another way molecules, or fragments of molecules, can be selected.

More information on selections can be found in the ["Tools" section](tools-selection-tool) and the ["Select" menu](menus-select-menu).
