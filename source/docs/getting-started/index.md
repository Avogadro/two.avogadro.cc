# Getting Started

It's easy to get started with Avogadro, including drawing molecules, selecting atoms and saving files:

* [Introduction](introduction)
* [Drawing Molecules](drawing-molecules)
* [Making Selections](making-selections)
* [Saving Files](saving-files)

We also have a series of walk-through tutorial videos on the [@AvogadroProject YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AvogadroProject)
