# Avogadro 1.90.0

3 December 2016

We are pleased to announce the latest release of Avogadro, including piles of
bug fixes and feature enhancements.

In particular v1.90 includes substantial improvements for handling crystallographic unit cells, including space group symmetry, and handling VASP calculations, as a result of a Google Summer of Code project of Patrick Avery.
