# Avogadro v2

Avogadro 2 is currently in beta. It was re-written from scratch to address a number of issues with the [Avogadro v1](v1) codebase.

Major concerns in Avogadro 1.0 focused on stability (i.e., crashes) and speed, particularly with molecules or systems over a few hundred atoms. **Avogadro v2 was designed for fast modern rendering and improved stability. It is a platform to make it easy to build the next generation of molecular and materials visualization and editing tools.**
