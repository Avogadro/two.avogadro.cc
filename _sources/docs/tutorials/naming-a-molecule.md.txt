# Naming a Molecule

Avogadro includes support for naming compounds using the PubChem database, which includes over 112 million compounds. Since these are deposited by chemical suppliers, pharmaceutical companies, etc. the database may not cover _**every**_ molecule you may build, but includes a broad selection of compounds.

As you modify the molecule (e.g., adding a Cl atom), the name will update automatically with the other properties, albeit while temporarily showing (pending)
