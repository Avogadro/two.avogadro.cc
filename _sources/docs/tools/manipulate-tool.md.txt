The manipulate tool is automatically selected when inserting a fragment. This allows the fragment to be rotated into position.

The "Translate by:" section allows you to easily translate the length of a bond \(to a fragment or atom\) into the desired positon. For a translation to take place, enter in the desired translation and then click "Apply".

The "Rotate around:" section allows you to rotate your selection around the current geometry, or the origin. After choosing how many degrees to rotate your selection click "Apply".

Clicking "Reset" will reset all of the information in the translation, and rotation boxes. This does not reset the molecule, if you want to undo your adjustments go to the "Edit" menu in the top bar and select "Undo Manipulate Atom".
