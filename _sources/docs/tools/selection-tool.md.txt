There are three types of selection modes: "Atom/Bond", "Residue", and "Molecule".

The "Atom/Bond" selection mode provides you with the ability to select a single atom within a molecule. This is achieved by left clicking the atom. Pressing down the "Shift" button on your keyboard allows the selection of multiple atoms.

Right clicking on the black display will clear the selection made.

The "Residue" selection mode will select an entire residue within the molecule, by clicking on a single atom in the residue.
