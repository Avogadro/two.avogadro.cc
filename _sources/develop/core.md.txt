# Avogadro::Core

The Core classes provide the fundamental data structures for chemistry,
including molecules, atoms, bonds, residues, unit cells, basis sets,
and related utilities. These classes have no dependency on Qt or OpenGL,
making them suitable for use in non-GUI contexts and Python bindings.
